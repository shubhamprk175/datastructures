# Queue

## Introduction
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

## List of Programs
- ### [Queue using Array](Queue.java)  
  The program [Queue.java](Queue.java) contains the implementation of the using Array data structure. The program [QueueHelper.java](QueueHelper.java) utilizes the datastructure and let you push and pop elements in the Queue, also giving you the functionality to print the queue.

- ### [Queue using Linked List](QueueLinkedList.java)  
  The Program [QueueLinkedList.java](QueueLinkedList.java) contains the implementation for Queue using Linked List data structure. The program [QueueImplementer.java](QueueImplementer.java) utilizes the datastructure and let you push and pop elements in the Queue, also giving you the functionality to print the queue.
